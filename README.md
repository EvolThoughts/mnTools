# mnTools

This is a toolbox for dealing with neuronal morphology.  It allows the importation of '.swc' and BBP '.h5' morphology files, the individual and population analysis (and figure generation) of the morphologies; the extraction of parameter/local measure relationships, and the algorithmic generation ("synthesis") of virtual neurons.

The code is currently in MATLAB, but I am slowly working to port it to Python.
